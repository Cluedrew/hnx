hnx
===

The hnx script for changing keyboards.

It is a very simple script, switches between the us qwerty keyboard and the us dvorak left-handed keyboard.
If you happen to use both the querty and dvorak one a computer it is useful. It also uses keys that stay the
same over the two keyboard layouts, so the user doesn't have to know the other layout, or even know which
layout is in use at the time.

PLANS:

Create a man(ual) page for the script.

Turn the script into a full package (.deb)
